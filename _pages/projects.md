**Contributed to MindSpore\(an open-source deep learning framework from Huawei\)**
**Operator Development:** 
Individually completed the migration of over ten computation operators from PyTorch to MindSpore. Accomplished the development of operators such as AdjustGamma, GriffinLim, Vad, and etc.. Development tasks encompassed operator IR layer implementation, operator implementation, C++ layer interfaces, Python layer interfaces, as well as unit testing. The coding work involves implementing FFT and SGD in C++. The performance of delivered operators met the acceptance criteria, and have been merged into the main branch.

**Model Migration:**
Conducted inference and training for the DEIT model on Huawei Ascend 910/310 AI chips. This involved converting the model using ONNX and PyTorch, validating inference accuracy and speed, and analyzing algorithm performance using profiling to identify bottlenecks. Adjusted training strategies on the Huawei NPU platform to replicate model accuracy.

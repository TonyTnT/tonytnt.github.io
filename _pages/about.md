My name is Chen Chen (陈晨), 
I am currently an associate researcher at <a href="https://hzii.buaa.edu.cn" target="_blank">Hangzhou Innovation Insitute, Beihang University</a>. 
I received my MA.Eng from Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn" target="_blank">Beihang University</a>, advised by <a href="https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/07382/en/index.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Jianwei Niu</a>, and <a href="https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1388/8172.htm" target="_blank"> Prof. Dr. Xuefeng Liu</a> for my Bachelor thesis on Medical Image Analysis.
I obtained my B.Eng. at <a href="https://english.tyut.edu.cn" target="_blank">Taiyuan University of Technology</a>, majoring in Computer science and technology.

My current job description:
1. Self-developed differential mobile robot: 
- Responsible for hardware selection, ROS package development and migration, CAN communication with motor servos, multi-sensor fusion for obstacle avoidance, and ROS DDS middleware communication parameter configuration.
- Developed web-based robot control software, featuring a Vue-based frontend and a NestJS-based backend, encapsulating ROS node topics to enable rviz functionality on the web interface.

2. Indoor collaborative robot research(based on key projects in Zhejiang Province): 
- Debugging of self-developed quad-axis SCARA arms.
- Design and construct workflow of the LLM-SegDet-Chroma, to achieve LLM control collaborative robots(fully self-developed SCARA arm with mobile robot) for ineraction with objets indoor environment.
- Deploying deep learning algorithms(YOLO) on domestic embedded boards(Rockchip RK3588), utilizing edge-side NPUs.
- Overseeing project progress and aligning monthly with participating universities and enterprises.

3. student guidance: 
- collaboration with doctoral students to carry out research in the field of visual slam, based on NICE-SLAM; 
- guide students to carry out research on LLM(Large Language Model) control with collaborative robots, to build toy examples of embodied artificial intelligence;
- guide students to carry out research on medical image segmentation.


My current research interet is Medical Image Analysis, and LLM with Robot.
